# jsGame1

A place to doodle games in JavaScript.

Based on this HTML5 game-dev [intro](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopherleedeleon/) by Christopher Lee DeLeon, who's done much in the field, including:

Creating this repo just in case I want to code along, although I may just absorb the information for future use.

Happy Coding. :smiley:
